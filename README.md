The cc65 cross-compiler suite
=============================

This is a Copy of my version of the CC65 toolset to work specifically with my emulator, it has opcodes, not originally supported by any 6502 based system,
this includes support for 9 general purpose registers, opcodes to directly manipulate video memory, based on sync signal given by the cpu, and more to come,
i dont care much about breaking compability with other targets,
so i highly discourage the use of this on other targets, if you do, i dont take the blame if things break, but i dont claim to have made this, 
the list of people, as taken from the CC65 repository and unmodified is below

## People

cc65 is originally based on the "Small C" compiler by Ron Cain and
enhanced by James E. Hendrix.
